Language modelling- definition
N-gram language model
Conditional probability
Problems with n gram- sparsity (more with large n i.e >5)(solution- additional delta i.e. smoothing), not much context, no data for last n-1 words (solution- back-off), storage
Fixed window neural language model- advantages, disadvantages
RNNs- recurrent neural networks- features, advantages, disadvantages
Hidden states
Unrolling
Training RNN-LM
Backpropagation through time
Text generation
Perplexity (lower-better)
Sentence classification
Encoder module
