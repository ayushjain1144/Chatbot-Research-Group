Classification setup- inputs(x) with dimension d, labels(y), training dataset, samples
Finding classifier i.e division boundary between 2 classes.
Linear classifier- softmax/logistic regression
For each training example(x,y), our objective is to maximize probability of correct class or minimize cross entropy loss( negative log probability of that class, -log p(y|x).
Detatils of cross emtropy
Need of neural network classifiers( non linear decision boundaries) for complex probems.
Neuraon structure and function.
Artificial neuron( sort of binary logistic regression units).
Neural network- running several logistic regressions at the same time.
We need multilayer neural networks.
Matrix notation for a layer.
Significance of activation function(f).
NER(Named entity recognition)- to find and classify names in text, ambiguous and depends on context.
BIO encoding
Softmax window classification
Binary true window classification
Corrupt windows- not having named entity location in their centre- many in number, thus easy to find.
SGD use
Matrix calculus introduction- chain rule, useful jacobians
Output shapes of gradient of score wrt all variables.
Backpropagation
Local error signal or delta
