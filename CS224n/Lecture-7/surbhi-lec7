Vanishing gradient problem-  meaning, proof, why this is a problem, it's effect on RNN-LM, fixes(lstm, skip connection/Resnet), can be a problem for all neural architectures ex- ResNet
Identity connection
Dense connection/DenseNet
Highway connection/HighwayNet
Exploring gradient problem- meaning, why this is a problem, bad updates, can result in inf/nan, solution (gradient clipping)
Lstm
3 gates- forget, input, output
Sigmoid function
New cell content
Cell state
Hidden state
Equations
 gru( simpler lstm)
2 gates- update, reset
New hidden state content, hidden state
Equations
Lstm vs gru
Bidirectional rnn- for sentiment classification, equations, uses, BERT
Multilayer rnn- meaning, use, working
